# Water_Level_Indicator_using_Arduino_with_automated_motor

In this project I have used Arduino UNO, Jumper Wires, Water Level Sensor, Breadboard, LED(Red, Green, Yellow, Blue), DC Pump Motor(5V), Servo Motor, Motor Controller.

INTRODUCTION

The circuit is designed to indicate four levels of water stored in the tank: 
Empty
low but not empty
Half
full but not overflowing
When there is no water in the tank, the red led will glow with buzzer. When water level increases and touches the sensor, the Yellow LED will glow indicating that there is water within the tank. As the water level continues to rise and reaches half the tank, green LED will glow. When the water in the tank rises to full blue led glow. 

OVERVIEW

The Water Level Indicator works on the principle of change in the resistance of the water level sensor due to a change in the amount of water in the container.

Basically, there are two parallel strips in the water level sensor, one for the power supply and another is for the sensor strip. As we know, water is a conductor of electricity so when we increase the amount of water in the container then more length of the sensor emerges in the water and that will increase the conductivity between the strips therefore, it increases the voltage on the sensor pin as well.
